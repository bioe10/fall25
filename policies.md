## Course Description
This course is designed to introduce undergraduates to the types of problems that bioengineers solve and the concepts they apply to solve them. Various types of devices -- from genetically engineered bacteria to biosensors -- will be discussed, and we will explore the physics and biology necessary to understand and design each of these devices. In addition, students will learn how to work effectively in groups and communicate their results in a professional manner.

**Objectives:** To introduce students to the field of bioengineering and, in general, to thinking about problems and solutions in the field ethically and effectively.

## Course Format
- Live Lecture on Tu/Th 11:00A-12:29P in 105 Stanley Hall
- Discussion Sections at various days/times and locations
    - 50-minute in-person discussion sections with required attendance (will not be recorded)
    - Two excused absences allowed

## Important Notes
- Class recordings and materials should not be shared with people outside of the class (though
they may be shared with DSP). The copyright is held by the instructor.
- The instructors cannot help you get into, or switch discussion sections within, the course. These
must be managed via the [Student Information System](https://sis.berkeley.edu/help/enrollment-faq/switching-related-sections).
- There will be no Discussion sections or office hours during the first (truncated) week of class
(8/23 - 8/25). Sections and office hours will begin to meet on the following Monday (8/28).
- There will be no Discussion sections or GSI office hours during the week of Thanksgiving
(Monday 11/20 - Friday 11/24).
- There is no textbook for the course, but online readings will be assigned.
- BioE 10 does not have a final exam. The final exam time slot is automatically given to us by the
campus and will not be used.
- You will need to access journal articles for this class. If you are not using the campus network,
you may need to follow [these instructions](https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/help/connect-off-campus) for library access.


## Email Policy
We recommend using the Ed Discussion app on bCourses to ask for peer help before emailing instructors. If you have a private question, you may email an instructor. Do not send the same email to all instructors separately; either cc all instructors or email just one person. Please add the “+bioe10” to the end of all instructor emails as written on the syllabus. All emails sent to the professor or GSIs should have [BIOE-10] in the subject line. Failure to include this may result in delayed responses. If your email is not responded to within a reasonable 72 hours, please check that you included [BIOE-10] in your subject line.

## Grading
There are a variety of assignments for the course available on bCourses, where you can find their point values and due dates. You typically get several weeks to complete assignments, most are due towards the end of the month. This is so that you can work flexibly and balance other responsibilities.

Students are strongly encouraged to work ahead when possible because they will receive no credit for late work. Last-minute extensions, barring extraordinary circumstances, will not be granted. If there is a power outage or similar situation, all due dates will be pushed back, and details will be communicated via bCourses announcements.

A total of 300 points can be earned in BioE 10. The final grading is not curved, and the breakdown is
as follows.

| Grade | Score |
|:------|:------|
| A | 270 |
| A- | 260 |
| B+ | 250 |
| B | 240 |
| B- | 230 |
| C+ | 220 |
| C | 210 |
| C-/P | 200 |
| D+ | 190 |
| D | 180 |
| D- | 170 |

We expect you to work with others in this class. While copying on individual assignments is not allowed, collaboration on these assignments is very much encouraged. You will be assigned a project group and they - or another group of students in the class - should be a regular part of your week as you work together to understand the material and complete assignments.

There will also be assignments that are turned in as a group. The instructor reserves the right to assign different grades to various members of the group, or to remove a member from a group to work on an ad hoc individual assignment, if the workload on a group assignment is not distributed and carried out evenly. Students who are taking the class on a Pass/Fail basis should take special note of this policy.

Assignments fall into a few different categories:
- **Module quizzes**: These quizzes are really homeworks. Some are graded automatically, and others use a combination of automatic and human grading. They are not timed like a quiz, they are simply due on their due date, so feel free to open and read them as early as you like. Students will have five attempts at submitting each quiz. Therefore, you have an opportunity to receive feedback on the automatically graded portions and improve. These tend to be challenging, and your version of the quiz will typically be different from other students’ versions.
- **Section work**: The due dates for these assignments will fluctuate. Some of the due dates will be assigned in your Discussion section.
- **Final project paper & presentation**: See below. This is due at the end of our scheduled final exam time.

### Grading Breakdown

| Category | Assignment | Points | Percentage |
|:---------|:-----------|:-------|:-----------|
| Homework | Module quizzes | 120 | 40% |
| Discussion | Journal article summary assignment  | 30 | 10% |
| Discussion | Attendance  | 30 | 10% |
| Final Project | Final Project presentation  | 30 | 10% |
| Final Project | Final Project paper  | 70 | 23.3% |
| Final Project | Final Project reflective activities  | 20 | 6.7% |

This model gives you more authority over your workflow than weekly assignments do, but with that comes the responsibility to keep up with the material. If you wait until the last week to attempt to complete a month’s worth of work, you will find it difficult to get all the help that you need in the time remaining. That’s on you.

Be aware of [UC Berkeley's Code of Student Conduct](https://studentaffairs.berkeley.edu/student-affairs-policies/). Plagiarism or cheating will not be tolerated and will result, at minimum, in a zero for the assignment. Plagiarism includes appropriation of whole passages with or without credit, appropriation of words and phrases without credit, appropriation of both main and supporting ideas without credit, and paraphrasing without credit. Plagiarism also includes submitting a paper written by someone else.

### Regrade policy
If you would like to contest a grade, you must send an email to your Discussion Section GSI with [BioE 10 REGRADE] in the subject line, briefly describing the issue within 1 week of the grade being posted.

- You should not expect that the instructor or the GSI will regrade anything while in conversation with you - that would not be fair to the other students in the class whose homework has been graded without them present.
- Regrade requests should be based on an error on our part (e.g., adding up the points incorrectly) or what you suspect is a misunderstanding of your work (e.g., arriving at the correct answer using an unexpected technique).
- Regrade requests that argue with the rubric (e.g., “this is wrong, but you took too many points off”) will not be considered.

Your homework should stand alone. If homework is disorganized or ambiguous and requires an extensive explanation to the grader, you will likely still lose points.

### Asking for help
Dealing with unavoidable circumstances is part of our job as Instructors and TAs. If something is preventing you from a satisfactory engagement with this course, consult the [Academic Accommodations Hub](https://evcp.berkeley.edu/programs-resources/academic-accommodations-hub) to determine if there is a campus resource that can guide you. If there is, the instructors will work together with that resource to accommodate you. If not, or if you are unsure, please contact us.

## Religious Creed Policy
The Berkeley campus’ Religious Creed Policy accommodates students who miss exams because of their religious commitment. The policy is as follows:

In compliance with Education code, Section 92640(a), it is the official policy of the University of California at Berkeley to permit any student to undergo a test or examination, without penalty, at a time when that activity would not violate the student’s religious creed unless administering the examination at an alternate time would impose an undue hardship which could not reasonably have been avoided. Requests to accommodate a student’s religious creed by scheduling tests or examinations at alternative times should be submitted directly to the faculty member responsible for administering the examination. Reasonable common sense, judgment, and the pursuit of mutual goodwill should result in the positive resolution of scheduling conflicts. The regular campus appeals process applies if a mutually satisfactory arrangement cannot be achieved.
